We recieved no aid on this assignment and solely worked with eachother.

============================
= Most inefficient Process =
============================

The routine in our optimized UM that takes up the most time
is the calls to the segment.c file and the assembly code could 
not be optimized in a way to help this.  To solve this the code would
have to be further condensed and destroying modularity that we felt 
was nessesary to remain in the final version.

= Time Spent =
==============

We spent about 3 hours analyzing the problems in this assigment.

We spent about 5 hours optimizing the UM (solving the problems).
